       <p>Are gender norms really that bad?    </p>

    </article>

    <article class="a3I textbox slideR sideR show-on-scroll">
      <p>Yes. Even worse when you don’t conform to any of them in the first place.</p>

    <article class="a4I textbox slideL sideL show-on-scroll">
      <p>How so?</p>
    </article>

   <article class="a5I textbox slideR sideR show-on-scroll">
      <p>Well, gender stereotypes or norms affects everyone because we are “assignned” one and are expected to follow some of its roles or character.</p>
    </article>

    <article class="a6I textbox slideR sideR show-on-scroll">
      <p>Even as a child, we are expected to behave like every other boy or every other girl. We become the odd one out if we do not act like the rest based on what we were born with.
</p>    </article>

    <article class="a7I textbox slideR sideR show-on-scroll">
      <p>But what happens when you do not identify to any of the genders in the first place? There should not be a trait that is applied to every  peson just based on a gender.
</p>
    </article>

    <article class="a8I textbox slideR sideR show-on-scroll">
<p>
  There should not be a "rule" where someone should expect to act someway because of what gender they are born with or how they look like physically.
</p>
    </article>

    <article class="a9I textbox slideR sideR show-on-scroll">
      <p>The same way there should not be a gender applied to every person, since some of us do not really identify ourselves with the biological gender we we’re born with.
