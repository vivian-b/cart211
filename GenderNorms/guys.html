        <p>Sure I am a guy, but why does that even matter? It’s about time we drop the gender stereotypes...

        <p>What's so wrong about gender stereotypes? For guys it means you are strong

          Like any other kind of stereotypes, there are good sides and bad sides. Just the sheer fact that we are expected to be acting in some way based on our is unreal.

          There should not be a trait that is applied to every guy. The same goes for thinking all guys are expected to be violent or sporty.

  When it comes to men, you best believe we are expected to not cry in front of others. Better yet, not show weakness.

          It is not like we picture you all to be the ideal male… Many movies for example, might tend to show those tropes, but we all know it is fictional and does not apply to everyone.

          The old traditions of the caring mother at home and the man as the breadwinner has changed and is no longer the standard.

      <article class="a11 textbox slideL sideL show-on-scroll">
        <p>Besides, many of us know that stereotypes are just sayings. No one truly believes that you must conform to the norms. </p>

        <p>Right. But stereotypes or norms still have their effects on people…</p>

        <p>Some standards might have changed, but it would be better if there aren’t any related to our gender. </p>

Even when we’re just kids, we are expected to behave like boys and not be “girly”. It becomes a standard that indirectly teaches us to look down on the other gender.

        It’s like saying “don’t be like that person because it is a bad example”. Why is being a girl a bad example to boys? Why is being emotional a feminine trait that is discouraged for guys?

But gender norms is an issue that still persists… The sayings about “be manly” or boys will be boys has its effects. Sure we know not everyone acts like that at the end of the day, but that mentality is still quite frustrating.

          But all of these “sayings” don’t apply that long into our lives does it? Maybe as a kid it disciplines us someway, but in the future it wouldn’t be that much of a problem.

Even as we grow older, gender stereotypes affects us in our workplaces. We unintentionally create gender norms or roles from our experiences.

If we were taught that guys are not supposed to show caring feelings usually, for some, seeing a male nurse would be weird. Just the fact of having jobs tied to a gender is quite unusual because that ignores one’s personality over their gender.

          In the end, just don’t judge someone by their gender.
