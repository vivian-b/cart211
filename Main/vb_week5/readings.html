  <p class="readings_answer"> While some individuals see the bright side of sharing – such as GNU’s objectives where sharing would benefit in the amount of time spent (instead of breaking their head on something that has already been done, reference someone who has already done the job) – most seem to see it as an opportunity for others to leech off their hard work. I feel like the act of sharing has been tainted with the thought of stealing and laziness. In my opinion, copying is, most of the time, more likely to be an act of our lack of patience (avoiding what could possibly be a waste of time) rather than our lack of motivation (too lazy, or not willing to working hard). Copying can be beneficial in a lot of domains (time saver), but it can also be hurtful in others(disrespect).

<p class="readings_answer">From a more creative side, copying is more likely seen in a bad way, especially when it is very apparent. For programming, people take advantage of existing programs to either improve it further or just build on top of it instead of wasting their time rebuilding what is already done. In a creative context, there may be some occasions where remixing things can be out of good intentions and not be seen as a disrespect to the original. I agree with the idea that every single creation is likely a result of the merging of things we were inspired by. But I believe there should be an extent to how similar your creation can be from another. I see copied programs as a way to make life easier for many. Copying works of art become a disrespect to the original when there is not a need to unless it’s to send a particular and different message through the structure of the original source. (For example: plagiarizing someone else’s work for grades does not prove a respectful or valid point from a creative standpoint)
