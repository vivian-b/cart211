<h3>Week 1</h3>
<a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1945/07/as-we-may-think/303881/">As We May Think</a>

<div class="text"><p>Technological advancement by itself has inarguably been going strong for the past two centuries.  Innovations are always surprising and exciting for the general public. While some inventions may be questionable, some may lead you to imagine a future where it could be further improved. In the article, the author traces back some machines we use today. All the writing about how the machines we have built through the ages has evolved to what it has become today is quite interesting and eye-opening. The beginning of the essay made me think twice about how some devices I use today functions, which helped me understand what they want to convey at the end, but still confused me for quite some time as I was not certain where the article was heading for.</p>

<p>From the long descriptions and analysis, the author theorizes and crafts an idea of a future fictional device. His proposal for “memex” is quite intriguing. The author describes it as a hypothetical device that is essentially a digital library that “stores all [of one’s] books, records, and communications, and which is mechanized so that it may be consulted with exceeding speed and flexibility”. From his examples of present-day mechanisms and gadgetry he referenced at the start and his explanation on human knowledge further in the essay, his idea does not seem too far off from possible realization. The main goal of the hypothetical invention is to help us in our intellectual journey so we can produce, store, and consult all the records put into it. While I am on board with the idea of his to create a smart device to help us in our intellectual journey, I wonder if he ever thought about how things can backfire.

<h3>Week 2</h3>
<a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/wjbbzq/canada-wanted-its-own-internet-in-the-70s">The Time Canada Wanted Its Own Internet Because It Thought the US Would Mess It Up</a> <br>
<a href="https://press.uchicago.edu/Misc/Chicago/817415_chap4.html">From Counterculture to Cyberculture</a>

<div class="text"><p>From the title of Daniel Joseph’s article, my first impression was that both countries had a childish fight over the internet. Reading the actual article made me realize that it was more serious and Canada was actually smart in the way they thought ahead many years ago. In fact, it is impressive that some topics that are relevant today were actually brought up in the past, yet dismissed. It is not a surprise that there have been many concerns about privacy on the net, especially after what happened in the United States in 2019 on net neutrality. As Canada is lacking a lot of power over the net, the country has perhaps become too reliant on its neighbor. The US has such a large monopoly in that domain that it makes sense that Canada tries to fall back. It is perhaps time for Canada to respect the previous warnings that many have ignored in the past and proceed to have some power of their own on the net in hopes of breaking free from their independence from the US.</p>

<p>From the computers to the internet and to laptops, the topic of technological advancement will always bring me surprises. Fred Turner’s article describes in detail the steps that took for desktop computers, which were for public uses, to become what we know now as a laptop, which is a target for people’s personal usage. Computers were only seen as calculating machines; then they evolved into personal machines capable of executing various commands (programming) and became more than a just tool. Personal use no longer meant that it was only for work or education, but also for entertainment and perhaps art. I’m interested to see how programming evolved in the direction of entertainment such as gaming and content (videos and images) and how people viewed such evolution (one that started pointing more towards entertainment rather than work.
