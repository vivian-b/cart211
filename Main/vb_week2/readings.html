<a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/wjbbzq/canada-wanted-its-own-internet-in-the-70s">The Time Canada Wanted Its Own Internet Because It Thought the US Would Mess It Up</a> <br>

<div class="text"><p>From the title of Daniel Joseph’s article, my first impression was that both countries had a childish fight over the internet. Reading the actual article made me realize that it was more serious and Canada was actually smart in the way they thought ahead many years ago. In fact, it is impressive that some topics that are relevant today were actually brought up in the past, yet dismissed. It is not a surprise that there have been many concerns about privacy on the net, especially after what happened in the United States in 2019 on net neutrality. As Canada is lacking a lot of power over the net, the country has perhaps become too reliant on its neighbor. The US has such a large monopoly in that domain that it makes sense that Canada tries to fall back. It is perhaps time for Canada to respect the previous warnings that many have ignored in the past and proceed to have some power of their own on the net in hopes of breaking free from their independence from the US.</p>

<p>From the computers to the internet and to laptops, the topic of technological advancement will always bring me surprises. Fred Turner’s article describes in detail the steps that took for desktop computers, which were for public uses, to become what we know now as a laptop, which is a target for people’s personal usage. Computers were only seen as calculating machines; then they evolved into personal machines capable of executing various commands (programming) and became more than a just tool. Personal use no longer meant that it was only for work or education, but also for entertainment and perhaps art. I’m interested to see how programming evolved in the direction of entertainment such as gaming and content (videos and images) and how people viewed such evolution (one that started pointing more towards entertainment rather than work.
