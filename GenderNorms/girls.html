        <p>Like any other kind of stereotypes, there are good sides and bad sides. Just the sheer fact that we are expected to be acting in some way based on our gender is unreal.

      <article class="a7 textbox slideR sideR verF  show-on-scroll">
        <p>There should not be a trait that is applied to every girl. The same goes for thinking all girls are expected to be delicate and weak.

        <p>When it comes to women, you best believe we are expected to be submissive. Better yet, not be too rash.</p>

          It is not like we picture you all to be the ideal female… Many movies for example, might tend to show those tropes, but we all know it is fictional and does not apply to everyone.

          The old traditions of the caring mother at home and the man as the breadwinner has changed and is no longer the standard.

        <p>Besides, many of us know that stereotypes are just sayings. No one truly believes that you must conform to the norms. </p>

        <p>Right. But stereotypes or norms still have their effects on people…</p>

        <p>Some standards might have changed, but it would be better if there aren’t any related to our gender. </p>

      <article class="a14 textbox slideR sideR verF  show-on-scroll">
        <p>Even when we’re just kids, we are expected to behave like girls and not be “boyish”. It becomes a standard that indirectly teaches us to look down on the other gender.

      <article class="a15 textbox slideR sideR verF  show-on-scroll">
        <p>It’s like saying “don’t be like that person because it is a bad example”. Why is being a boy a bad example to girls? Why is being furious a masculine trait that is discouraged for girls?</p>

          Well, those stereotypes have started to become outdated.

          But gender norms is an issue that still persists… The sayings about “being too girly” in a negative way has it's effects. Sure we know not everyone acts like that at the end of the day, but that mentality is still quite frustrating.

        <p>
          But all of these “sayings” don’t apply that long into our lives does it? Maybe as a kid it disciplines us someway, but in the future it wouldn’t be that much of a problem.

        <p>
          If we were taught that guys are the dominant ones usually, for some, seeing a woman in charge would be weird. Just the fact of having job positions tied to a gender is quite unusual because that ignores one’s personality over their gender.
