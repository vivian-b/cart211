              <p>Well, gender stereotypes or norms affects everyone because we are “assignned” one and are expected to follow some of its roles or character.</p>

              <p>Even as a child, we are expected to behave like every other boy or every other girl. We become the odd one out if we do not act like the rest based on what we were born with.

              <p>But what happens when you do not identify to any of the genders in the first place? There should not be a trait that is applied to every peson just based on a gender.

                There should not be a "rule" where someone should expect to act someway because of what gender they are born with or how they look like physically.

              <p>The same way there should not be a gender applied to every person, since some of us do not really identify ourselves with the biological gender we we’re born with.
