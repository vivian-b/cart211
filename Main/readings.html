  <h3>Week 1</h3>
  <div class="readinglink"><a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1945/07/as-we-may-think/303881/">As We May Think</a>
  </div>

  <div class="text"><p class="readings_answer">Technological advancement by itself has inarguably been going strong for the past two centuries.  Innovations are always surprising and exciting for the general public. While some inventions may be questionable, some may lead you to imagine a future where it could be further improved. In the article, the author traces back some machines we use today. All the writing about how the machines we have built through the ages has evolved to what it has become today is quite interesting and eye-opening. The beginning of the essay made me think twice about how some devices I use today functions, which helped me understand what they want to convey at the end, but still confused me for quite some time as I was not certain where the article was heading for.</p>

  <p class="readings_answer">From the long descriptions and analysis, the author theorizes and crafts an idea of a future fictional device. His proposal for “memex” is quite intriguing. The author describes it as a hypothetical device that is essentially a digital library that “stores all [of one’s] books, records, and communications, and which is mechanized so that it may be consulted with exceeding speed and flexibility”. From his examples of present-day mechanisms and gadgetry he referenced at the start and his explanation on human knowledge further in the essay, his idea does not seem too far off from possible realization. The main goal of the hypothetical invention is to help us in our intellectual journey so we can produce, store, and consult all the records put into it. While I am on board with the idea of his to create a smart device to help us in our intellectual journey, I wonder if he ever thought about how things can backfire.

  <h3>Week 2</h3>
  <div class="readinglink"><a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/wjbbzq/canada-wanted-its-own-internet-in-the-70s">The Time Canada Wanted Its Own Internet Because It Thought the US Would Mess It Up</a> <br>
  <a href="https://press.uchicago.edu/Misc/Chicago/817415_chap4.html">From Counterculture to Cyberculture</a></div>

  <div class="text"><p class="readings_answer">From the title of Daniel Joseph’s article, my first impression was that both countries had a childish fight over the internet. Reading the actual article made me realize that it was more serious and Canada was actually smart in the way they thought ahead many years ago. In fact, it is impressive that some topics that are relevant today were actually brought up in the past, yet dismissed. It is not a surprise that there have been many concerns about privacy on the net, especially after what happened in the United States in 2019 on net neutrality. As Canada is lacking a lot of power over the net, the country has perhaps become too reliant on its neighbor. The US has such a large monopoly in that domain that it makes sense that Canada tries to fall back. It is perhaps time for Canada to respect the previous warnings that many have ignored in the past and proceed to have some power of their own on the net in hopes of breaking free from their independence from the US.

  <p class="readings_answer">From the computers to the internet and to laptops, the topic of technological advancement will always bring me surprises. Fred Turner’s article describes in detail the steps that took for desktop computers, which were for public uses, to become what we know now as a laptop, which is a target for people’s personal usage. Computers were only seen as calculating machines; then they evolved into personal machines capable of executing various commands (programming) and became more than a just tool. Personal use no longer meant that it was only for work or education, but also for entertainment and perhaps art. I’m interested to see how programming evolved in the direction of entertainment such as gaming and content (videos and images) and how people viewed such evolution (one that started pointing more towards entertainment rather than work.

  <h3>Week 3</h3>
  <div class="readinglink"><a href="http://cyberhouse.arted.psu.edu/visualculture/history_net_art.pdf"> Web Work: A History of Internet Art</a>
  <a href="https://www.artnews.com/art-news/news/the-new-world-of-net-art-2236/">The New World of Net Art</a>
  </div>

  <p class="readings_answer">Reading Greene’s article was a surprise as I have never ever really seen or heard about this type of art before. While the net art communities were shown to be lively and permitted artists around the world to connect to each other, I wonder if the interactions between artists through the net are the same as today. Since online forums were not really a thing in the past, I wonder how often they would share their ideas and art with each other and how the general public would find their creations.
  </p>

  <p class="readings_answer">It was a given that, with a new intriguing canvas such as the Net, artists would look into it and see how they can explore it and express themselves through it. It surprises me a little that this type of movement is still being developed today, yet is barely mentioned or shown off more publicly as it is an interesting environment for expressing art. Moreso the fact that most of our society is always on the net, yet don’t seem to explore in it as much as we think.
  </p>

  <p class="readings_answer">The topic of Net Art made me think about how this could perhaps be linked to web design. Out of all the visual examples shown in the article, the ones that captured my attention were those which seemed to be following structured compositions. Those examples looked to me as if the focus has shifted from being about the imagery and expression, but more on aesthetics in presenting the information.

<h3>Week 4</h3>
<div class="readinglink"> <a href="https://www.gnu.org/gnu/manifesto.html">Richard Stallman, The GNU Manifesto</a></p> </div>
<div class="readinglink"> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJPERZDfyWc&feature=youtu.be">Everything is a Remix Remastered, Kirby Ferguson (video)</a></p> </div>

  <p class="readings_answer"> While some individuals see the bright side of sharing – such as GNU’s objectives where sharing would benefit in the amount of time spent (instead of breaking their head on something that has already been done, reference someone who has already done the job) – most seem to see it as an opportunity for others to leech off their hard work. I feel like the act of sharing has been tainted with the thought of stealing and laziness. In my opinion, copying is, most of the time, more likely to be an act of our lack of patience (avoiding what could possibly be a waste of time) rather than our lack of motivation (too lazy, or not willing to working hard). Copying can be beneficial in a lot of domains (time saver), but it can also be hurtful in others(disrespect). </p>
  <p class="readings_answer">From a more creative side, copying is more likely seen in a bad way, especially when it is very apparent. For programming, people take advantage of existing programs to either improve it further or just build on top of it instead of wasting their time rebuilding what is already done. In a creative context, there may be some occasions where remixing things can be out of good intentions and not be seen as a disrespect to the original. I agree with the idea that every single creation is likely a result of the merging of things we were inspired by. But I believe there should be an extent to how similar your creation can be from another. I see copied programs as a way to make life easier for many. Copying works of art become a disrespect to the original when there is not a need to unless it’s to send a particular and different message through the structure of the original source. (For example: plagiarizing someone else’s work for grades does not prove a respectful or valid point from a creative standpoint)

  <div class="readinglink"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR76Iqh1a1A&feature=emb_title">Culture Jamming and Online Activism</a></p> </div>

  <p class="readings_answer"> I have mixed feelings about pranks as I usually cringe when I see some of them happen. I understand that there is usually a goal in playing tricks on someone for amusement and such. In the videos I have viewed today, I see these activist acts as large pranks to bring attention to a serious topic. Something like satire. While it does fool some people and manages to send a message and make the public aware of a certain topic. I can't help but think about those who were trully gullible and somehow get hurt in believing in false hopes. In any case, it achievied it's goal which is what activism is meant to be. It's just the manner it is done is quite unusual and funnier than other, probably way serious and maybe dangerous, alternatives to voice out.</p>
