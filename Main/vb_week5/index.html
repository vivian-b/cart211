    <p> I see the canvas as a playground where rules are but toys I either mess with or break in repetition. Perhaps I am childish. I continuously learn new things to do and new ways to play the field. Designing becomes a game I enjoy with no perfect ending. The strongest weapon to venture on any mission is creativity. I mix it with my ability to combine letterforms, colors, and spacing. Everything in every place has its unique mood and color to spark inspiration for me to build my never-ending train of ideas.

    <p>  I am never on the playground by myself. The viewers' interaction with my creations is crucial to my work.  It all depends on how they view, understand, and remember my work. My goal is to capture the eyes and the minds of the admirers, for them to experience the same excitement as I have when discovering new ideas. From designing on different types of paper with a pencil to the various digital screen sizes with a mouse,  I wish to venture into the in-between of the digital and the tangible world and merge them. From there, I invite others to join so they can interact and enjoy my work as we create a memorable experience together.
      </p> <br>

      <p>My mission is not to love my creations, but to gain experience from the challenges I face and improve my craft. Every experience is thrilling and challenging, more so when I find myself on more difficult and unfamiliar grounds. There are many ways to complete a task, but the solution never sets in stone. Time changes as answers lose their relevance for more fitting ones.
      <br><br>Design evolves, so must I.
