<h2>Week 1 - Reading</h2>
<p>Technological advancement by itself has inarguably been going strong for the past two centuries.  Innovations are always surprising and exciting for the general public. While some inventions may be questionable, some may lead you to imagine a future where it could be further improved. In the article, the author traces back some machines we use today. All the writing about how the machines we have built through the ages has evolved to what it has become today is quite interesting and eye-opening. The beginning of the essay made me think twice about how some devices I use today functions, which helped me understand what they want to convey at the end, but still confused me for quite some time as I was not certain where the article was heading for.

<p>From the long descriptions and analysis, the author theorizes and crafts an idea of a future fictional device. His proposal for “memex” is quite intriguing. The author describes it as a hypothetical device that is essentially a digital library that “stores all [of one’s] books, records, and communications, and which is mechanized so that it may be consulted with exceeding speed and flexibility”. From his examples of present-day mechanisms and gadgetry he referenced at the start and his explanation on human knowledge further in the essay, his idea does not seem too far off from possible realization. The main goal of the hypothetical invention is to help us in our intellectual journey so we can produce, store, and consult all the records put into it. While I am on board with the idea of his to create a smart device to help us in our intellectual journey, I can’t help but worry how far this can backfire. I dare say, Black Mirror has conditioned me to think twice on smart devices and technological advancement when it comes to personal security.</p>
