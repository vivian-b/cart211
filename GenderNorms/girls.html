                But gender norms is an issue that still persists… The sayings about “being too girly” in a negative way has it's effects. Sure we know not everyone acts like that at the end of the day, but that mentality is still quite frustrating.

              But all of these “sayings” don’t apply that long into our lives does it? Maybe as a kid it disciplines us someway, but in the future it wouldn’t be that much of a problem.

                Even as we grow older, gender stereotypes affects us in our workplaces. We unintentionally create gender norms or roles from our experiences.

                If we were taught that guys are the dominant ones usually, for some people, seeing a woman in charge would be weird. Just the fact of having job positions tied to a gender is quite unusual because that ignores one’s personality over
                their gender.
