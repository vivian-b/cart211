    <h3>Week 3</h3>
    <div class="readinglink"><a href="http://cyberhouse.arted.psu.edu/visualculture/history_net_art.pdf"> Web Work: A History of Internet Art</a>
      <a href="https://www.artnews.com/art-news/news/the-new-world-of-net-art-2236/">The New World of Net Art</a>
  </div>

    <p>Reading Greene’s article was a surprise as I have never ever really seen or heard about this type of art before. While the net art communities were shown to be lively and permitted artists around the world to connect to each other, I wonder if the interactions between artists through the net are the same as today. Since online forums were not really a thing in the past, I wonder how often they would share their ideas and art with each other and how the general public would find their creations.
</p>
    <p>It was a given that, with a new intriguing canvas such as the Net, artists would look into it and see how they can explore it and express themselves through it. It surprises me a little that this type of movement is still being developed today, yet is barely mentioned or shown off more publicly as it is an interesting environment for expressing art. Moreso the fact that most of our society is always on the net, yet don’t seem to explore in it as much as we think.
</p>

    <p>The topic of Net Art made me think about how this could perhaps be linked to web design. Out of all the visual examples shown in the article, the ones that captured my attention were those which seemed to be following structured compositions. Those examples looked to me as if the focus has shifted from being about the imagery and expression, but more on aesthetics in presenting the information.
